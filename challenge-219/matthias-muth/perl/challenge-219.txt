Task 1: Sorted Squares
Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar

You are given a list of numbers.
Write a script to square each number in the list and return the sorted list, increasing order.
Example 1

Input: @list = (-2, -1, 0, 3, 4)
Output: (0, 1, 4, 9, 16)

Example 2

Input: @list = (5, -4, -1, 3, 6)
Output: (1, 9, 16, 25, 36)


Task 2: Travel Expenditure
Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar

You are given two list, @costs and @days.
The list @costs contains the cost of three different types of travel cards you can buy.
For example @costs = (5, 30, 90)
Index 0 element represent the cost of  1 day  travel card.
Index 1 element represent the cost of  7 days travel card.
Index 2 element represent the cost of 30 days travel card.

The list @days contains the day number you want to travel in the year.
For example: @days = (1, 3, 4, 5, 6)
The above example means you want to travel on day 1, day 3, day 4, day 5 and day 6 of the year.

Write a script to find the minimum travel cost.
Example 1:

Input: @costs = (2, 7, 25)
       @days  = (1, 5, 6, 7, 9, 15)
Output: 11

On day 1, we buy a one day pass for 2 which would cover the day 1.
On day 5, we buy seven days pass for 7 which would cover days 5 - 9.
On day 15, we buy a one day pass for 2 which would cover the day 15.

So the total cost is 2 + 7 + 2 => 11.

Example 2:

Input: @costs = (2, 7, 25)
       @days  = (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 11, 12, 14, 20, 30, 31)
Output: 20

On day 1, we buy a seven days pass for 7 which would cover days 1 - 7.
On day 10, we buy a seven days pass for 7 which would cover days 10 - 14.
On day 20, we buy a one day pass for 2 which would cover day 20.
On day 30, we buy a one day pass for 2 which would cover day 30.
On day 31, we buy a one day pass for 2 which would cover day 31.

So the total cost is 7 + 7 + 2 + 2 + 2 => 20.
