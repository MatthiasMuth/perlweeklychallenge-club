Task 1: Matching Members
Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar

You are given a list of positive integers, @ints.
Write a script to find the total matching members after sorting the list increasing order.

Example 1

Input: @ints = (1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 3)
Output: 3

Original list: (1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 2)
Sorted list  : (1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4)

Compare the two lists, we found 3 matching members (1, 1, 2).

Example 2

Input: @ints = (5, 1, 2, 3, 4)
Output: 0

Original list: (5, 1, 2, 3, 4)
Sorted list  : (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

Compare the two lists, we found 0 matching members.

Example 3

Input: @ints = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
Output: 5

Original list: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
Sorted list  : (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

Compare the two lists, we found 5 matching members.


Task 2: Last Member
Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar

You are given an array of positive integers, @ints.
Write a script to find the last member if found otherwise return 0. Each turn pick any 2 members (x, y) then decide based on the following conditions, continue this until you are left with 1 member or none.
a) if x == y then remove both members
b) if x != y then remove both members and add new member (y-x)

Example 1:

Input: @ints = (2, 7, 4, 1, 8, 1)
Output: 1

Step 1: pick 7 and 8, we remove both and add new member 1 => (2, 4, 1, 1, 1).
Step 2: pick 2 and 4, we remove both and add new member 2 => (2, 1, 1, 1).
Step 3: pick 2 and 1, we remove both and add new member 1 => (1, 1, 1).
Step 4: pick 1 and 1, we remove both => (1).

Example 2:

Input: @ints = (1)
Output: 1

Example 3:

Input: @ints = (1, 1)
Output: 0

Step 1: pick 1 and 1, we remove both and we left with none.
