I haven't had the motivation to say much here lately, but I also feel like I haven't had much to say. I suppose I've been busy with other stuff, and haven't been doing my usual programming language roulette, although, really, what's more important than the PWC?!

I did see there's some tight competition between Ruby and Rust, hence my Rust contribution in support of my pick. I do have a soft spot in my heart for Ruby, so nothing personal of course.

Thanks for the challenges!
