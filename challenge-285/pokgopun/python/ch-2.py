Task 2: Making Change

Submitted by: [50]David Ferrone
     __________________________________________________________________

   Compute the number of ways to make change for given amount in cents. By
   using the coins e.g. Penny, Nickel, Dime, Quarter and Half-dollar, in
   how many distinct ways can the total value equal to the given amount?
   Order of coin selection does not matter.
A penny (P) is equal to 1 cent.
A nickel (N) is equal to 5 cents.
A dime (D) is equal to 10 cents.
A quarter (Q) is equal to 25 cents.
A half-dollar (HD) is equal to 50 cents.

Example 1

Input: $amount = 9
Ouput: 2

1: 9P
2: N + 4P

Example 2

Input: $amount = 15
Ouput: 6

1: D + 5P
2: D + N
3: 3N
4: 2N + 5P
5: N + 10P
6: 15P

Example 3

Input: $amount = 100
Ouput: 292
