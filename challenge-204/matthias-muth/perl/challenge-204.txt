Task 1: Monotonic Array
Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar

You are given an array of integers.
Write a script to find out if the given array is Monotonic. Print 1 if it is otherwise 0.
An array is Monotonic if it is either monotone increasing or decreasing.
Monotone increasing: for i <= j , nums[i] <= nums[j]
Monotone decreasing: for i <= j , nums[i] >= nums[j]


Example 1
Input: @nums = (1,2,2,3)
Output: 1

Example 2
Input: @nums = (1,3,2)
Output: 0

Example 3
Input: @nums = (6,5,5,4)
Output: 1


Task 2: Reshape Matrix
Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar

You are given a matrix (m x n) and two integers (r) and (c).
Write a script to reshape the given matrix in form (r x c) with the original value in the given matrix. If you canâ€™t reshape print 0.

Example 1
Input: [ 1 2 ]
       [ 3 4 ]

       $matrix = [ [ 1, 2 ], [ 3, 4 ] ]
       $r = 1
       $c = 4

Output: [ 1 2 3 4 ]

Example 2
Input: [ 1 2 3 ]
       [ 4 5 6 ]

       $matrix = [ [ 1, 2, 3 ] , [ 4, 5, 6 ] ]
       $r = 3
       $c = 2

Output: [ [ 1, 2 ], [ 3, 4 ], [ 5, 6 ] ]

        [ 1 2 ]
        [ 3 4 ]
        [ 5 6 ]

Example 3
Input: [ 1 2 ]

       $matrix = [ [ 1, 2 ] ]
       $r = 3
       $c = 2

Output: 0
