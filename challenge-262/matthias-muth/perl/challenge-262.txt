Task 1: Max Positive Negative
Submitted by: Mohammad Sajid Anwar

You are given an array of integers, @ints.
Write a script to return the maximum number of either positive or negative integers in the given array.
Example 1

Input: @ints = (-3, 1, 2, -1, 3, -2, 4)
Output: 4

Count of positive integers: 4
Count of negative integers: 3
Maximum of count of positive and negative integers: 4

Example 2

Input: @ints = (-1, -2, -3, 1)
Output: 3

Count of positive integers: 1
Count of negative integers: 3
Maximum of count of positive and negative integers: 3

Example 3

Input: @ints = (1,2)
Output: 2

Count of positive integers: 2
Count of negative integers: 0
Maximum of count of positive and negative integers: 2


Task 2: Count Equal Divisible
Submitted by: Mohammad Sajid Anwar

You are given an array of integers, @ints and an integer $k.
Write a script to return the number of pairs (i, j) where
a) 0 <= i < j < size of @ints
b) ints[i] == ints[j]
c) i x j is divisible by k

Example 1

Input: @ints = (3,1,2,2,2,1,3) and $k = 2
Output: 4

(0, 6) => ints[0] == ints[6] and 0 x 6 is divisible by 2
(2, 3) => ints[2] == ints[3] and 2 x 3 is divisible by 2
(2, 4) => ints[2] == ints[4] and 2 x 4 is divisible by 2
(3, 4) => ints[3] == ints[4] and 3 x 4 is divisible by 2

Example 2

Input: @ints = (1,2,3) and $k = 1
Output: 0
