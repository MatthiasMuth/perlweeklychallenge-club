Task 2: String Score
Submitted by: Mohammad Sajid Anwar

You are given a string, $str.
Write a script to return the score of the given string.
The score of a string is defined as the sum of the absolute difference between the ASCII values of adjacent characters.

Example 1
Input: $str = "hello"
Output: 13
ASCII values of characters:
h = 104
e = 101
l = 108
l = 108
o = 111
Score => |104 - 101| + |101 - 108| + |108 - 108| + |108 - 111|
      => 3 + 7 + 0 + 3
      => 13

Example 2
Input: "perl"
Output: 30
ASCII values of characters:
p = 112
e = 101
r = 114
l = 108
Score => |112 - 101| + |101 - 114| + |114 - 108|
      => 11 + 13 + 6
      => 30

Example 3
Input: "raku"
Output: 37
ASCII values of characters:
r = 114
a = 97
k = 107
u = 117
Score => |114 - 97| + |97 - 107| + |107 - 117|
      => 17 + 10 + 10
      => 37
