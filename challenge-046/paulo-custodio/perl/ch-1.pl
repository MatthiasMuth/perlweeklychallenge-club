# TASK #1
# Cryptic Message
# The communication system of an office is broken and message received are not
# completely reliable. To send message Hello, it ended up sending these following:
#
# H x l 4 !
# c e - l o
# z e 6 l g
# H W l v R
# q 9 m # o
# Similary another day we received a message repeatedly like below:
#
# P + 2 l ! a t o
# 1 e 8 0 R $ 4 u
# 5 - r ] + a > /
# P x w l b 3 k \
# 2 e 3 5 R 8 y u
# < ! r ^ ( ) k 0
# Write a script to decrypt the above repeated message (one message repeated 6
# times).
#
# HINT: Look for characters repeated in a particular position in all six messages
# received.
