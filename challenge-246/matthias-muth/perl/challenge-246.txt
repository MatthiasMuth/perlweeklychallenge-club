Task 2: Linear Recurrence of Second Order
Submitted by: Jorg Sommrey

You are given an array @a of five integers.
Write a script to decide whether the given integers form a linear recurrence of second order with integer factors.
A linear recurrence of second order has the form
a[n] = p * a[n-2] + q * a[n-1] with n > 1

where p and q must be integers.


Example 1

Input: @a = (1, 1, 2, 3, 5)
Output: true

@a is the initial part of the Fibonacci sequence a[n] = a[n-2] + a[n-1]
with a[0] = 1 and a[1] = 1.

Example 2

Input: @a = (4, 2, 4, 5, 7)
Output: false

a[1] and a[2] are even. Any linear combination of two even numbers with integer factors is even, too.
Because a[3] is odd, the given numbers cannot form a linear recurrence of second order with integer factors.

Example 3

Input: @a = (4, 1, 2, -3, 8)
Output: true

a[n] = a[n-2] - 2 * a[n-1]
