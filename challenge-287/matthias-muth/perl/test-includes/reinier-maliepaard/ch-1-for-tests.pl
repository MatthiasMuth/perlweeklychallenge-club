The task isn't to generate a strong password, but simply to check how many
steps are needed to turn a given string into a strong password. If a character
is missing, you only need to count the insertion of that character. In the case
of repeating character triplets, you just need to break the triplet by replacing
one of the characters with another. I used a space to count the number of triplet
replacements. And if the number of triplet breaks is greater than the number of
missing characters, then the total number of steps is equal to the number of
triplet breaks: after all, a missing character could have been used to break the
triplet.
