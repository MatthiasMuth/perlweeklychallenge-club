You are given a string, $str.

Write a program to return the minimum number of steps required to make the given string very strong password. If it is already strong then return 0.

Criteria:

- It must have at least 6 characters.
- It must contains at least one lowercase letter, at least one upper case letter and at least one digit.
- It shouldn't contain 3 repeating characters in a row.

Following can be considered as one step:

- Insert one character
- Delete one character
- Replace one character with another

Example 1

Input: $str = "a"
Output: 5

Example 2

Input: $str = "aB2"
Output: 3

Example 3

Input: $str = "PaaSW0rd"
Output: 0

Example 4

Input: $str = "Paaasw0rd"
Output: 1

Example 5

Input: $str = "aaaaa"
Output: 2
