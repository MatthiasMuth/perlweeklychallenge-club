Task 1: Minimum Index Sum
Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar

You are given two arrays of strings.
Write a script to find out all common strings in the given two arrays with minimum index sum. If no common strings found returns an empty list.
Example 1

Input: @list1 = ("Perl", "Raku", "Love")
       @list2 = ("Raku", "Perl", "Hate")

Output: ("Perl", "Raku")

There are two common strings "Perl" and "Raku".
Index sum of "Perl": 0 + 1 = 1
Index sum of "Raku": 1 + 0 = 1

Example 2

Input: @list1 = ("A", "B", "C")
       @list2 = ("D", "E", "F")

Output: ()

No common string found, so no result.

Example 3

Input: @list1 = ("A", "B", "C")
       @list2 = ("C", "A", "B")

Output: ("A")

There are three common strings "A", "B" and "C".
Index sum of "A": 0 + 1 = 1
Index sum of "B": 1 + 2 = 3
Index sum of "C": 2 + 0 = 2


Task 2: Duplicate and Missing
Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar

You are given an array of integers in sequence with one missing and one duplicate.
Write a script to find the duplicate and missing integer in the given array. Return -1 if none found.
For the sake of this task, let us assume the array contains no more than one duplicate and missing.
Example 1:
Input: @nums = (1,2,2,4)
Output: (2,3)

Duplicate is 2 and Missing is 3.

Example 2:
Input: @nums = (1,2,3,4)
Output: -1

No duplicate and missing found.

Example 3:
Input: @nums = (1,2,3,3)
Output: (3,4)

Duplicate is 3 and Missing is 4.
