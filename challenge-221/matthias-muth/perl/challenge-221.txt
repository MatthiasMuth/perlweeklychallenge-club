Task 1: Good Strings
Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar

You are given a list of @words and a string $chars.

A string is good if it can be formed by characters from $chars, each character can be used only once.

Write a script to return the sum of lengths of all good strings in words.

Example 1

Input: @words = ("cat", "bt", "hat", "tree")
       $chars = "atach"
Output: 6

The good strings that can be formed are "cat" and "hat" so the answer is 3 + 3 = 6.

Example 2

Input: @words = ("hello", "world", "challenge")
       $chars = "welldonehopper"
Output: 10

The strings that can be formed are "hello" and "world" so the answer is 5 + 5 = 10.


Task 2: Arithmetic Subsequence
Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar

You are given an array of integers, @ints.
Write a script to find the length of the longest Arithmetic Subsequence in the given array.

A subsequence is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or none elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
A subsquence is arithmetic if ints[i + 1] - ints[i] are all the same value (for 0 <= i < ints.length - 1).

Example 1:

Input: @ints = (9, 4, 7, 2, 10)
Output: 3

The longest Arithmetic Subsequence (4, 7, 10) can be derived by deleting 9 and 2.

Example 2:

Input: @ints = (3, 6, 9, 12)
Output: 4

No need to remove any elements, it is already an Arithmetic Subsequence.

Example 3:

Input: @ints = (20, 1, 15, 3, 10, 5, 8)
Output: 4

The longest Arithmetic Subsequence (20, 15, 10, 5) can be derived by deleting 1, 3 and 8.
