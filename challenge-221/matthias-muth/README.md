# Challenge 221 tasks: Good Strings - Arithmetic Subsequence
**Challenge 221 solutions in Perl by Matthias Muth**

## Task 1: Good Strings

> You are given a list of @words and a string $chars.<br/>
> <br/>
> A string is good if it can be formed by characters from $chars, each character can be used only once.<br/>
> <br/>
> Write a script to return the sum of lengths of all good strings in words.<br/>

```perl
sub task_1() {
    return undef;
}
```

## Task 2: Arithmetic Subsequence

> You are given an array of integers, @ints.<br/>
> Write a script to find the length of the longest Arithmetic Subsequence in the given array.<br/>
> <br/>
> A subsequence is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or none elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.<br/>
> A subsquence is arithmetic if ints[i + 1] - ints[i] are all the same value (for 0 <= i < ints.length - 1).<br/>

```perl
sub task_2() {
    return undef;
}
```
