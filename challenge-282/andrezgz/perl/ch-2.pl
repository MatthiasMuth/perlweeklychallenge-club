# Task #2 > Changing Keys
#
# You are given an alphabetic string, $str, as typed by user.
#
# Write a script to find the number of times user had to change the key to type the given string. Changing key is defined as using a key different from the last used key. The shift and caps lock keys wonâ€™t be counted.
#
# Example 1
# Input: $str = 'pPeERrLl'
# Ouput: 3
#
# p -> P : 0 key change
# P -> e : 1 key change
# e -> E : 0 key change
# E -> R : 1 key change
# R -> r : 0 key change
# r -> L : 1 key change
# L -> l : 0 key change
#
# Example 2
# Input: $str = 'rRr'
# Ouput: 0
#
# Example 3
# Input: $str = 'GoO'
# Ouput: 1
