Task 1: Banking Day Offset
Submitted by: Lee Johnson

You are given a start date and offset counter. Optionally you also get bank holiday date list.
Given a number (of days) and a start date, return the number (of days) adjusted to take into account non-banking days. In other words: convert a banking day offset to a calendar day offset.
Non-banking days are:
a) Weekends
b) Bank holidays

Example 1

Input: $start_date = '2018-06-28', $offset = 3, $bank_holidays = ['2018-07-03']
Output: '2018-07-04'

Thursday bumped to Wednesday (3 day offset, with Monday a bank holiday)

Example 2

Input: $start_date = '2018-06-28', $offset = 3
Output: '2018-07-03'


Task 2: Line Parser
Submitted by: Gabor Szabo

You are given a line like below:

{%  id   field1="value1"    field2="value2"  field3=42 %}


Where
a) "id" can be \w+.
b) There can be 0  or more field-value pairs.
c) The name of the fields are \w+.
b) The values are either number in which case we don't need double quotes or string in
   which case we need double quotes around them.


The line parser should return structure like below:

{
       name => id,
       fields => {
           field1 => value1,
           field2 => value2,
           field3 => value3,
       }
}


It should be able to parse the following edge cases too:

{%  youtube title="Title \"quoted\" done" %}


and

{%  youtube title="Title with escaped backslash \\" %}


BONUS: Extend it to be able to handle multiline tags:

{% id  filed1="value1" ... %}
LINES
{% endid %}


You should expect the following structure from your line parser:

{
       name => id,
       fields => {
           field1 => value1,
           field2 => value2,
           field3 => value3,
       }
       text => LINES
}


Last date to submit the solution 23:59 (UK Time) Sunday 10th March 2024.
