```

## Task 2: Roman Maths

> Write a script to handle a 2-term arithmetic operation expressed in Roman numeral.<br/>
> Example<br/>
> <br/>
> IV + V     => IX<br/>
> M - I      => CMXCIX<br/>
> X / II     => V<br/>
> XI * VI    => LXVI<br/>
> VII ** III => CCCXLIII<br/>
> V - V      => nulla (they knew about zero but didn't have a symbol)<br/>
> V / II     => non potest (they didn't do fractions)<br/>
> MMM + M    => non potest (they only went up to 3999)<br/>
> V - X      => non potest (they didn't do negative numbers)<br/>
