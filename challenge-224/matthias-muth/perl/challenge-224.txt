Task 1: Special Notes
Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar

You are given two strings, $source and $target.
Write a script to find out if using the characters (only once) from source, a target string can be created.
Example 1

Input: $source = "abc"
       $target = "xyz"
Output: false

Example 2

Input: $source = "scriptinglanguage"
       $target = "perl"
Output: true

Example 3

Input: $source = "aabbcc"
       $target = "abc"
Output: true


Task 2: Additive Number
Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar

You are given a string containing digits 0-9 only.
Write a script to find out if the given string is additive number. An additive number is a string whose digits can form an additive sequence.
A valid additive sequence should contain at least 3 numbers. Except the first 2 numbers, each subsequent number in the sequence must be the sum of the preceding two.

Example 1:

Input: $string = "112358"
Output: true

The additive sequence can be created using the given string digits: 1,1,2,3,5,8
1 + 1 => 2
1 + 2 => 3
2 + 3 => 5
3 + 5 => 8

Example 2:

Input: $string = "12345"
Output: false

No additive sequence can be created using the given string digits.

Example 3:

Input: $string = "199100199"
Output: true

The additive sequence can be created using the given string digits: 1,99,100,199
 1 +  99 => 100
99 + 100 => 199
