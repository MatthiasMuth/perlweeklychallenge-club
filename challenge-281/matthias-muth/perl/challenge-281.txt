Task 2: Knightâ€™s Move
Submitted by: Peter Campbell Smith

A Knight in chess can move from its current position to any square two rows or columns plus one column or row away. So in the diagram below, if it starts a S, it can move to any of the squares marked E.
Write a script which takes a starting position and an ending position and calculates the least number of moves required.


Example 1
Input: $start = 'g2', $end = 'a8'
Ouput: 4
g2 -> e3 -> d5 -> c7 -> a8

Example 2
Input: $start = 'g2', $end = 'h2'
Ouput: 3
g2 -> e3 -> f1 -> h2
