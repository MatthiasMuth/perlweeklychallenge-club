Task 1: Count Primes
Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar

You are given a positive integer, $n.
Write a script to find the total count of primes less than or equal to the given integer.

Example 1

Input: $n = 10
Output: 4

Since there are 4 primes (2,3,5,7) less than or equal to 10.

Example 2

Input: $n = 1
Output: 0

Example 3

Input: $n = 20
Output: 8

Since there are 4 primes (2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19) less than or equal to 20.


Task 2: Box Coins
Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar

You are given an array representing box coins, @box.
Write a script to collect the maximum coins until you took out all boxes. If we pick box[i] then we collect the coins $box[i-1] * $box[i] * $box[i+1]. If $box[i+1] or $box[i-1] is out of bound then treat it as 1 coin.

Example 1:

Input: @box = (3, 1, 5, 8)
Output: 167

Step 1: pick box [i=1] and collected coins 3 * 1 * 5 => 15.  Boxes available (3, 5, 8).
Step 2: pick box [i=1] and collected coins 3 * 5 * 8 => 120. Boxes available (3, 8).
Step 3: pick box [i=0] and collected coins 1 * 3 * 8 => 24.  Boxes available (8).
Step 4: pick box [i=0] and collected coins 1 * 8 * 1 => 8.   No more box available.

Example 2:

Input: @box = (1, 5)
Output: 10

Step 1: pick box [i=0] and collected coins 1 * 1 * 5 => 5. Boxes available (5).
Step 2: pick box [i=0] and collected coins 1 * 5 * 1 => 5. No more box available.
