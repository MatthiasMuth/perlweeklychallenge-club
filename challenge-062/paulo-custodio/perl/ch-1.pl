# TASK #1 > Sort Email Addresses
# Submitted by: Neil Bowers
# Reviewed by: Ryan Thompson
#
# Write a script that takes a list of email addresses (one per line) and sorts
# them first by the domain part of the email address, and then by the part to
# the left of the @ (known as the mailbox).
#
# Note that the domain is case-insensitive, while the mailbox part is case
# sensitive. (Some email providers choose to ignore case, but that's another
# matter entirely.)
#
# If your script is invoked with arguments, it should treat them as file names
# and read them in order, otherwise your script should read email addresses from
# standard input.
#
# Bonus
# Add a -u option which only includes unique email addresses in the output, just
# like sort -u.
#
# Example
# If given the following list:
#
# name@example.org
# rjt@cpan.org
# Name@example.org
# rjt@CPAN.org
# user@alpha.example.org
# Your script (without -u) would return:
#
# user@alpha.example.org
# rjt@cpan.org
# rjt@CPAN.org
# Name@example.org
# name@example.org
# With -u, the script would return:
#
# user@alpha.example.org
# rjt@CPAN.org
# Name@example.org
# name@example.org
