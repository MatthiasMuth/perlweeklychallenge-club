Task 1: Count Even Digits Number
Submitted by: Mohammad Sajid Anwar

You are given a array of positive integers, @ints.
Write a script to find out how many integers have even number of digits.
Example 1

Input: @ints = (10, 1, 111, 24, 1000)
Output: 3

There are 3 integers having even digits i.e. 10, 24 and 1000.

Example 2

Input: @ints = (111, 1, 11111)
Output: 0

Example 3

Input: @ints = (2, 8, 1024, 256)
Output: 1


Task 2: Sum of Values
Submitted by: Mohammad Sajid Anwar

You are given an array of integers, @int and an integer $k.
Write a script to find the sum of values whose index binary representation has exactly $k number of 1-bit set.
Example 1

Input: @ints = (2, 5, 9, 11, 3), $k = 1
Output: 17

Binary representation of index 0 = 0
Binary representation of index 1 = 1
Binary representation of index 2 = 10
Binary representation of index 3 = 11
Binary representation of index 4 = 100

So the indices 1, 2 and 4 have total one 1-bit sets.
Therefore the sum, $ints[1] + $ints[2] + $ints[4] = 17

Example 2

Input: @ints = (2, 5, 9, 11, 3), $k = 2
Output: 11

Example 3

Input: @ints = (2, 5, 9, 11, 3), $k = 0
Output: 2
