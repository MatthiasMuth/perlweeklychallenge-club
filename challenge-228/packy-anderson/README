## Perl

* [Task 1](perl/task-1.pl)

Sample output
```
$ perl/task-1.pl 2023
Input: $year = 2023
Output: 2
```
* [Task 2](perl/task-2.pl)

Sample output
```
$ perl/task-2.pl < task-2-input.txt
IV + V => IX
M - I => CMXCIX
X / II => V
XI * VI => LXVI
VII ** III => CCCXLIII
V - V => nulla (they knew about zero but didn't have a symbol)
V / II => non potest (they didn't do fractions)
MMM + M => non potest (they only went up to 3999)
V - X => non potest (they didn't do negative numbers)
$ echo "MMMM" | perl/task-2.pl
Lines must be of the form "operand1 operator operand2"
where both operands are valid roman numerals and the
operator is one of the following:  +  -  *  /  **
$ echo "X + Y" | perl/task-2.pl
'Y' is not a roman numberal!
```
