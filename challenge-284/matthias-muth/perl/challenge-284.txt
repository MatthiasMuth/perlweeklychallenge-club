Task 2: Relative Sort
Submitted by: Mohammad Sajid Anwar

You are given two list of integers, @list1 and @list2. The elements in the @list2 are distinct and also in the @list1.

Example 2
Input: @list1 = (3, 3, 4, 6, 2, 4, 2, 1, 3)
       @list2 = (1, 3, 2)
Ouput: (1, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 4, 4, 6)

Example 3
Input: @list1 = (3, 0, 5, 0, 2, 1, 4, 1, 1)
       @list2 = (1, 0, 3, 2)
Ouput: (1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 3, 2, 4, 5)
