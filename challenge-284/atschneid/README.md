# PWC 283

**Challenge 283 solutions by Andrew Schneider**

[PWC 283](https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-283/)

No blog this week. I had high hopes for this week. In Perl I planned to iteratively refine solutions to each challenge. I also wanted to try solving them using OCaml. But I ran out of time for the first, and just floundered on the second idea. It was a busy week I suppose.

I liked Dave Jacoby's remark a couple weeks back about not wanting to blog if he didn't have anything interesting/original to offer. Definitely nothing of that sort from me this week, ergo, no blog.

See you (maybe) next week!
