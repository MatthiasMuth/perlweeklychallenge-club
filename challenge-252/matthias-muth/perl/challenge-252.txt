Task 1: Special Numbers
Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar

You are given an array of integers, @ints.
Write a script to find the sum of the squares of all special elements of the given array.

An element $int[i] of @ints is called special if i divides n, i.e. n % i == 0.
Where n is the length of the given array. Also the array is 1-indexed for the task.


Example 1

Input: @ints = (1, 2, 3, 4)
Output: 21

There are exactly 3 special elements in the given array:
$ints[1] since 1 divides 4,
$ints[2] since 2 divides 4, and
$ints[4] since 4 divides 4.

Hence, the sum of the squares of all special elements of given array:
1 * 1 + 2 * 2 + 4 * 4 = 21.

Example 2

Input: @ints = (2, 7, 1, 19, 18, 3)
Output: 63

There are exactly 4 special elements in the given array:
$ints[1] since 1 divides 6,
$ints[2] since 2 divides 6,
$ints[3] since 3 divides 6, and
$ints[6] since 6 divides 6.

Hence, the sum of the squares of all special elements of given array:
2 * 2 + 7 * 7 + 1 * 1 + 3 * 3 = 63


Task 2: Unique Sum Zero
Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar

You are given an integer, $n.
Write a script to find an array containing $n unique integers such that they add up to zero.
Example 1

Input: $n = 5
Output: (-7, -1, 1, 3, 4)

Two other possible solutions could be as below:
(-5, -1, 1, 2, 3) and (-3, -1, 2, -2, 4).

Example 2

Input: $n = 3
Output: (-1, 0, 1)

Example 3

Input: $n = 1
Output: (0)
