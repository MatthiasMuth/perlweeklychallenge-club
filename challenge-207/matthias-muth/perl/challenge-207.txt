Task 1: Keyboard Word
Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar

You are given an array of words.
Write a script to print all the words in the given array that can be types using alphabet on only one row of the keyboard.

Row 1: qwertyuiop
Row 2: asdfghjkl
Row 3: zxcvbnm

Example 1
Input: @words = ("Hello","Alaska","Dad","Peace")
Output: ("Alaska","Dad")

Example 2

Output: ()


Task 2: H-Index
Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar

You are given an array of integers containing citations a researcher has received for each paper.
Write a script to compute the researcher’s H-Index. For more information please checkout the wikipedia page.
The H-Index is the largest number h such that h articles have at least h citations each. For example, if an author has five publications, with 9, 7, 6, 2, and 1 citations (ordered from greatest to least), then the author’s h-index is 3, because the author has three publications with 3 or more citations. However, the author does not have four publications with 4 or more citations.

Example 1
Input: @citations = (10,8,5,4,3)
Output: 4

Because the 4th publication has 4 citations and the 5th has only 3.

Example 2
Input: @citations = (25,8,5,3,3)
Output: 3

The H-Index is 3 because the fourth paper has only 3 citations.
