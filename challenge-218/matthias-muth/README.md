**Challenge ${CHALLENGE} solutions in Perl by Matthias Muth**

## Task 1: ${TASK_1_TITLE}

>${TASK_1_DESRIPTION}

Lore ipsum...

```perl
${TASK_1_CODE}
```

## Task 2: ${TASK_2_TITLE}

>${TASK_2_DESRIPTION}

```perl
${TASK_1_CODE}
```

## TestExtractor.pm

The 'TestExtractor.pm' module extracts the test cases from the
task description in the `perl/challenge-${CHALLENGE}.txt` file,
and runs the tests.

I have a script that every beginning of the week
extracts the new task descriptions from the
[Weekly Challenge web site](https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-${CHALLENGE}/)
and writes them into that file.

With the help of TestExtractor.pm it also writes code templates for both tasks,
complete with the correct input parameter names and types.

So as soon as a new challenge is published,
I can start hacking right away! <br/>
(Currently I am still hacking more that script than the challenges...! ;-D )

I will write about that in one of the coming weeks.

**Thank you for the challenge!**
