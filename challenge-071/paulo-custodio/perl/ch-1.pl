# TASK #1 > Peak Element
# Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
# You are given positive integer $N (>1).
#
# Write a script to create an array of size $N with random unique elements
# between 1 and 50.
#
# In the end it should print peak elements in the array, if found.
#
# An array element is called peak if it is bigger than it's neighbour.
#
# Example 1
# Array: [ 18, 45, 38, 25, 10, 7, 21, 6, 28, 48 ]
# Peak: [ 48, 45, 21 ]
# Example 2
# Array: [ 47, 11, 32, 8, 1, 9, 39, 14, 36, 23 ]
# Peak: [ 47, 32, 39, 36 ]
