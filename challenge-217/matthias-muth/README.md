**Challenge 216 solutions in Perl by Matthias Muth**
<br/>
I have created a 'TestExtractor.pm' module that extracts and runs the
test cases from the challenge description in 'challenge.txt'.
This makes the weekly task of setting up the enviroment for the new challenge
much easier.

(no blog post this time...)

**Thank you for the challenge!**
