**Challenge 216 solutions in Perl by Matthias Muth**
<p>
The 'TestExtractor.pm' module extracts and runs the test cases from the
challenge task description in the `perl/challenge-217.txt` file. <br/>
As I have a script that extracts the new task descriptions from the
[Weekly Challenge web site](https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-217/) every week,
this makes setting up the enviroment for the new challenge much easier.

(no blog post this time...)

**Thank you for the challenge!**
