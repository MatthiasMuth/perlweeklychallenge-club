# Challenge 286
#
# Task 1: Self Spammer
# Submitted by: David Ferrone
#
# Write a program which outputs one word of its own script / source code at
# random. A word is anything between whitespace, including symbols.
# Example 1
#
# If the source code contains a line such as:
# 'open my $fh, "<", "ch-1.pl" or die;'
# then the program would output each of the words { open, my, $fh,, "<",,
# "ch-1.pl", or, die; }
# (along with other words in the source) with some positive probability.
#
# Example 2
#
# Technically 'print(" hello ");' is *not* an example program, because it does
# not assign positive probability to the other two words in the script.
# It will never display print(" or ");
#
# Example 3
#
# An empty script is one trivial solution, and here is another:
# echo "42" > ch-1.pl && perl -p -e '' ch-1.pl

if n == -1:
    shuffle(words)
