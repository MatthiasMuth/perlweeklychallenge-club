# TASK #2 > Rob The House
# Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
# You are planning to rob a row of houses, always starting with the first
# and moving in the same direction. However, you can't rob two adjacent houses.
#
# Write a script to find the highest possible gain that can be achieved.
#
# Example 1:
# Input: @valuables = (2, 4, 5);
# Output: 7
#
# If we rob house (index=0) we get 2 and then the only house we can rob is
# house (index=2) where we have 5.
# So the total valuables in this case is (2 + 5) = 7.
#
# Example 2:
# Input: @valuables = (4, 2, 3, 6, 5, 3);
# Output: 13
#
# The best choice would be to first rob house (index=0) then rob house (index=3) then finally house (index=5).
# This would give us 4 + 6 + 3 =13.
