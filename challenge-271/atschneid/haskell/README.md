# Challenge 271

**Challenge 271 solutions in Haskell by Andrew Schneider**

### Some words
I have only just started learning Haskell. These solutions are basically the first things I have worked on. I have iterated on these solutions as I have worked my way through Learn You a Haskell. Tangentially, it's a great book for reading, but not so great for when I think, "what was that thing I learned about? what was the syntax?" and then try to find the section. But there are docs! I'm getting used to Haskell and I think these solutions look pretty good.

I wrote these in a literate style, so there is more explanation in the files that I don't need to repeat here. I'm not sure how I feel about literate programming at this point but it was interesting to try.

I compiled these using `ghc` (of course) without any issues. Check 'em out.
