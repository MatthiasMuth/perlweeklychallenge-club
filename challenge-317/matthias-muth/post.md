**Friendly Acronyms (PWC 317)**

Thank you Mohammad Sajid Anwar for week 317 of The Weekly Challenge!
These are my solutions in Perl.

**Task 1: Acronyms**
Anyone second that `/^(.)/` is nicer that `substr( $_, 0, 1 )`?

**Task 2: Friendly Strings**
Using `split`/`zip`/`grep` to reduce to only the *unequal* pairs of characters. Then using a couple of 'perlisms' for checking whether the unequal pairs actually are 'swapped'.    

**Blog post and source code:**
Find a blog post explaining the solutions, together with the complete source code, including tests, on github ( https://github.com/MatthiasMuth/perlweeklychallenge-club/tree/muthm-317/challenge-317/matthias-muth#readme ).

**Thank you for the challenge!**
