# Task 1: Third Maximum
# 
# Submitted by: Mohammad Sajid Anwar
# 
# You are given an array of integers, @ints.
# 
# Write a script to find the third distinct maximum in the given array. If third
# maximum doesnâ€™t exist then return the maximum number.
# 
# Example 1
# 
#     Input: @ints = (5, 6, 4, 1)
#     Output: 4
# 
#     The first distinct maximum is 6.
#     The second distinct maximum is 5.
#     The third distinct maximum is 4.
# 
# Example 2
# 
#     Input: @ints = (4, 5)
#     Output: 5
# 
#     In the given array, the third maximum doesn't exist therefore returns the
#     maximum.
# 
# Example 3
# 
#     Input: @ints =  (1, 2, 2, 3)
#     Output: 1
# 
#     The first distinct maximum is 3.
#     The second distinct maximum is 2.
#     The third distinct maximum is 1.
