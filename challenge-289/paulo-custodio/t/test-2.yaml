            |According to a research at Cambridge University, it doesn't matter
            |in what order the letters in a word are, the only important thing
            |is that the first and last letter be at the right place. The rest
            |can be a total mess and you can still read it without problem.
            |This is because the human mind does not read every letter by
            |itself, but the word as a whole.
