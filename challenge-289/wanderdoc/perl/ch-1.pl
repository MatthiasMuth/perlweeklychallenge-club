You are given an array of integers, @ints.

Write a script to find the third distinct maximum in the given array. If third maximum doesnâ€™t exist then return the maximum number.
Example 1

Input: @ints = (5, 6, 4, 1)
Output: 4

The first distinct maximum is 6.
The second distinct maximum is 5.
The third distinct maximum is 4.

Example 2

Input: @ints = (4, 5)
Output: 5

In the given array, the third maximum doesn't exist therefore returns the maximum.

Example 3

Input: @ints =  (1, 2, 2, 3)
Output: 1

The first distinct maximum is 3.
The second distinct maximum is 2.
The third distinct maximum is 1.
