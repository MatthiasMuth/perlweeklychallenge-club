You are given two arrays of integers, @source and @indices. The @indices can only contains integers 0 <= i < size of @source.
Write a script to create target array by insert at index $indices[i] the value $source[i].
Example 1

Input: @source  = (0, 1, 2, 3, 4)
       @indices = (0, 1, 2, 2, 1)
Output: (0, 4, 1, 3, 2)

@source  @indices  @target
0        0         (0)
1        1         (0, 1)
2        2         (0, 1, 2)

       @indices = (0, 1, 2, 3, 0)
Output: (0, 1, 2, 3, 4)

@source  @indices  @target
1        0         (1)
