Task 1: Shuffle String
Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar

You are given a string and an array of indices of same length as string.
Write a script to return the string after re-arranging the indices in the correct order.
Example 1

Input: $string = 'lacelengh', @indices = (3,2,0,5,4,8,6,7,1)
Output: 'challenge'

Example 2

Input: $string = 'rulepark', @indices = (4,7,3,1,0,5,2,6)
Output: 'perlraku'


Task 2: Zero Array
Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar

You are given an array of non-negative integers, @ints.
Write a script to return the minimum number of operations to make every element equal zero.
In each operation, you are required to pick a positive number less than or equal to the smallest element in the array, then subtract that from each positive element in the array.

Example 1:

Input: @ints = (1, 5, 0, 3, 5)
Output: 3

operation 1: pick 1 => (0, 4, 0, 2, 4)
operation 2: pick 2 => (0, 2, 0, 0, 2)
operation 3: pick 2 => (0, 0, 0, 0, 0)

Example 2:

Input: @ints = (0)
Output: 0

Example 3:

Input: @ints = (2, 1, 4, 0, 3)
Output: 4

operation 1: pick 1 => (1, 0, 3, 0, 2)
operation 2: pick 1 => (0, 0, 2, 0, 1)
operation 3: pick 1 => (0, 0, 1, 0, 0)
operation 4: pick 1 => (0, 0, 0, 0, 0)
