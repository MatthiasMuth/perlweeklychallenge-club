Task 2: Squareful
Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar

You are given an array of integers, @ints.
An array is squareful if the sum of every pair of adjacent elements is a perfect square.
Write a script to find all the permutations of the given array that are squareful.
Example 1:

Input: @ints = (1, 17, 8)
Output: (1, 8, 17), (17, 8, 1)

(1, 8, 17) since 1 + 8 => 9, a perfect square and also 8 + 17 => 25 is perfect square too.
(17, 8, 1) since 17 + 8 => 25, a perfect square and also 8 + 1 => 9 is perfect square too.

Example 2:

Input: @ints = (2, 2, 2)
Output: (2, 2, 2)

There is only one permutation possible.
