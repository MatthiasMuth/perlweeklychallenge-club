#
# Task 1: Shortest Distance
# Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar
#
# You are given a string and a character in the given string.
#
# Write a script to return an array of integers of size same as length of the given string such that:
#
# distance[i] is the distance from index i to the closest occurence of
# the given character in the given string.
#
# The distance between two indices i and j is abs(i - j).
#
# Example 1
#
# Input: $str = "loveleetcode", $char = "e"
# Output: (3,2,1,0,1,0,0,1,2,2,1,0)
#
# The character 'e' appears at indices 3, 5, 6, and 11 (0-indexed).
# The closest occurrence of 'e' for index 0 is at index 3, so the distance is abs(0 - 3) = 3.
# The closest occurrence of 'e' for index 1 is at index 3, so the distance is abs(1 - 3) = 2.
# For index 4, there is a tie between the 'e' at index 3 and the 'e' at index 5,
# but the distance is still the same: abs(4 - 3) == abs(4 - 5) = 1.
# The closest occurrence of 'e' for index 8 is at index 6, so the distance is abs(8 - 6) = 2.
#
# Example 2
#
# Input: $str = "aaab", $char = "b"
# Output: (3,2,1,0)
