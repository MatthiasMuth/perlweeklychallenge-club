Task 1: Shortest Distance
Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar

You are given a string and a character in the given string.
Write a script to return an array of integers of size same as length of the given string such that:
distance[i] is the distance from index i to the closest occurence of
the given character in the given string.

The distance between two indices i and j is abs(i - j).

Example 1

Input: $str = "loveleetcode", $char = "e"
Output: (3,2,1,0,1,0,0,1,2,2,1,0)

The character 'e' appears at indices 3, 5, 6, and 11 (0-indexed).
The closest occurrence of 'e' for index 0 is at index 3, so the distance is abs(0 - 3) = 3.
The closest occurrence of 'e' for index 1 is at index 3, so the distance is abs(1 - 3) = 2.
For index 4, there is a tie between the 'e' at index 3 and the 'e' at index 5,
but the distance is still the same: abs(4 - 3) == abs(4 - 5) = 1.
The closest occurrence of 'e' for index 8 is at index 6, so the distance is abs(8 - 6) = 2.

Example 2

Input: $str = "aaab", $char = "b"
Output: (3,2,1,0)


Task 2: Submatrix Sum
Submitted by: Jorg Sommrey

You are given a NxM matrix A of integers.
Write a script to construct a (N-1)x(M-1) matrix B having elements that are the sum over the 2x2 submatrices of A,
b[i,k] = a[i,k] + a[i,k+1] + a[i+1,k] + a[i+1,k+1]


Example 1

Input: $a = [
              [1,  2,  3,  4],
              [5,  6,  7,  8],
              [9, 10, 11, 12]
            ]

Output: $b = [
               [14, 18, 22],
               [30, 34, 38]
             ]

Example 2

Input: $a = [
              [1, 0, 0, 0],
              [0, 1, 0, 0],
              [0, 0, 1, 0],
              [0, 0, 0, 1]
            ]

Output: $b = [
               [2, 1, 0],
               [1, 2, 1],
               [0, 1, 2]
             ]
