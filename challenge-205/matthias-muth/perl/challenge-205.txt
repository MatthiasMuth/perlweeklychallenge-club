Task 1: Third Highest
Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar

You are given an array of integers.
Write a script to find out the Third Highest if found otherwise return the maximum.
Example 1
Input: @array = (5,3,4)
Output: 3

First highest is 5. Second highest is 4. Third highest is 3.

Example 2
Input: @array = (5,6)
Output: 6

First highest is 6. Second highest is 5. Third highest is missing, so maximum is returned.

Example 3
Input: @array = (5,4,4,3)
Output: 3

First highest is 5. Second highest is 4. Third highest is 3.


Task 2: Maximum XOR
Submitted by: Mohammad S Anwar

You are given an array of integers.
Write a script to find the highest value obtained by XORing any two distinct members of the array.
Example 1
Input: @array = (1,2,3,4,5,6,7)
Output: 7

The maximum result of 1 xor 6 = 7.

Example 2
Input: @array = (2,4,1,3)
Output: 7

The maximum result of 4 xor 3 = 7.

Example 3
Input: @array = (10,5,7,12,8)
Output: 15

The maximum result of 10 xor 5 = 15.
